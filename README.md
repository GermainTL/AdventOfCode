# AdventOfCode 2021 🎄
## 25 days of puzzles: https://adventofcode.com/ 

[AdventOfCode]  is an advent calendar where 2 puzzles are given each day between 1rst and 25fth of December. 🎄<br>

[AdventOfCode]: https://adventofcode.com/

*Only the code can help us solve them 👨‍💻*.<br>
The objective of the project is to solve all theses puzzles by [TDD], for educational purposes 🚀<br>

### 📖 Puzzle example (day 3 - puzzle 1)  : ###

<em>A scenario frames the puzzles. To cut a long story short, we are in a submarine that we must learn to pilot. 🚢</em>

#### --- Day 3: Binary Diagnostic --- ####

The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.

The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is the *power consumption*.

You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the *gamma rate* and the *epsilon rate*). The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.

Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the *most common bit in the corresponding position* of all numbers in the diagnostic report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:

```
00100
11110
10110
10111
10101
01111
00111
11100
10000
11001
00010
01010
```

Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five `0` bits and seven `1` bits. Since the most common bit is `1`, the first bit of the gamma rate is `1`.

The most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is `0`, so the second bit of the gamma rate is `0`.

The most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are `1`, `1`, and `0`, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are `110`.

So, the gamma rate is the binary number `10110`, or `*22*` in decimal.

The epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the most common bit, the least common bit from each position is used. So, the epsilon rate is `01001`, or `*9*` in decimal. Multiplying the gamma rate (`22`) by the epsilon rate (`9`) produces the power consumption, `*198*`.

Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. 

<strong> What is the power consumption of the submarine? (Be sure to represent your answer in decimal, not binary.)  </strong>
